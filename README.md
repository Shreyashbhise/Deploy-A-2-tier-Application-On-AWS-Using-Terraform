Deploy A 2-tier Application On AWS Using Terraform
The primary objective of this project was to design and deploy a scalable and highly available 2-Tier Architecture web application on AWS using Terraform. This architecture comprised two key tiers:

Presentation Tier (Frontend): This is where the user interacts with the application or service. It includes a web server, load balancer, and CDN (Content Delivery Network) for performance and scalability.
 
Data Tier (Backend): This tier hosts the application's database and any necessary application logic. It includes a database server and possibly application servers.
